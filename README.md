## Team 🤝

- **Calistas**: Team Lead
- **Hloni** : FrontEnd
- **Tshepo** : Fullstack
- **Sakhile** : Fullstack
- **Tshilidzi** : FrontEnd

We had a blast working on this project! As the team lead, I take full responsibility for the exhaustion of any API keys (we used RapidAPI and PlayAI for external APIs). I plan to keep enhancing this project as time allows.

## Note 📝

Due to the usage of external APIs, it's possible that API keys may need to be renewed or updated. Please check and update the keys as necessary.
